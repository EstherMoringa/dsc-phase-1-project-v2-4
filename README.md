Microsoft Film Studio Recommendations

Project Overview

For this project, you will use exploratory data analysis to generate insights for a business stakeholder.

Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they don’t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create

Data sources

•	Box office Mojo

•	IMDb

•	THENumbers

Objectives

•	Identify trends and patterns in the types of films that are performing well at the box office.

•	Analyze factors such as genre, budget, and release timing that contribute to a movie's success.

•	Provide actionable insights to Microsoft's movie studio head to inform decision-making on the types of films to produce.

Methods

1.	Data collection and cleaning: Gather relevant data from various sources and clean it to ensure consistency and accuracy.
2.	Exploratory data analysis (EDA): Conduct EDA to understand the distribution of variables, correlations, and trends in the data.
3.	Statistical analysis: Use statistical methods to analyze relationships between movie attributes (e.g., genre, budget) and box office performance metrics (e.g., revenue, profitability).
4.	Data visualization: Visualize insights using charts, graphs, and plots to make them understandable and actionable.
   

Results

1. Identification of popular movie genres, budget ranges, and release timings based on box office performance.
2. Insights into audience preferences and trends, such as the popularity of certain genres among different demographics.
3. Key factors influencing box office success, such as ratings, number of votes, costs, and critical acclaim.
4. Use the results based on a general analysis from both datas to drive concrete insights.
